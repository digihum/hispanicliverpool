=================

A backbonejs app for the Hispanic Liverpool project with AMD


This is a first backbone.js application, and cherrypicks the features of backbone that work for the project. Also worth noting that its being developed as a standalone, but will ultimately be delployed onto a content management system as an in-page js app.

Uses
----
* text plugin for mixing templates with .html.tpl extension
* requirejs for AMD implementation 

Todo
----
* Move from dataTables to backgrid with paginatebackgrid
* Link up the search form
* Consider whether modularising the main app.js will be beneficial. Currently its all in a single app.js because it was historically all on the single index.html
*Styling improvements requested to make this whole app more compact in appearance.
